# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2026-01-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a consistent way to record important architectural decisions, context, and consequences.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by [Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

- We will have a history of decisions.
- New developers can understand *why* things are the way they are.
